"Turism cu Noi" (Travel with Us) is an application designed to simplify the process of discovering tourist attractions in new locations. As avid travelers, we often found it time-consuming to identify the key attractions in unfamiliar places. To address this, we developed an application that saves time and enhances the travel experience by providing rapid suggestions for nearby attractions.

The application features an interactive map display that allows users to explore and navigate new areas with ease. By integrating external APIs, the app offers quick and accurate recommendations for popular tourist spots based on the user's current location. This functionality ensures that travelers can discover interesting places without extensive research.

In addition to suggesting attractions, the app enables efficient travel planning by allowing users to add and remove markers on the map. This feature helps in creating personalized travel itineraries tailored to individual preferences. The application's user-friendly interface, with its modern and intuitive design, ensures a smooth and enjoyable experience for all users.

Developed using technologies such as Python, Tkinter, and various mapping and API libraries, "Turism cu Noi" not only streamlines the travel planning process but also enriches the overall travel experience by making it easier to find and visit must-see locations.
